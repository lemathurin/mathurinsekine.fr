# Home Inventory App

Full source code: [Frontend](https://github.com), [Backend](#)

As part of my RNCP certification project, I designed and developed a full-stack web application. I implemented a modular, domain-driven architecture and granular access control based on RBAC.

The interface is responsive and compliant with RGAA accessibility standards. I automated continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions and deployed the application on a Hetzner VPS via Coolify. Code quality was ensured through unit and end-to-end testing. The UI/UX design was created using Figma.Â 

This project demonstrates my ability to manage all stages of web application development. From analysis and design, to deployment and documentation, in a secure, scalable, and collaborative environment.
