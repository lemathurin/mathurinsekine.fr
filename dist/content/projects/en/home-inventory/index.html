<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>
For my RNCP certification project, I designed and developed a full-stack web application. It allows users to list, organize, and manage their personal belongings within shared homes, with a role-based access control system (RBAC). The app runs on an Express + PostgreSQL backend and a modular layered Next.js frontend.
</p>
<p>
The design was created with accessibility, multi-user collaboration, and good UX in mind. The project is self-hosted on a Hetzner VPS via Coolify, with automated deployment, Jest and Cypress tests, and a strong focus on security.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project was completed as part of the RNCP certification <em>Application Developer Designer</em>, in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/PierrePedrono">Pierre Pedrono</a>.</p>
<p>It consists of building a web application called Home Inventory App, aimed at helping users list, organize, and categorize their personal items in a structured way. The app also aims to simplify sharing and collaborative management within a household or between multiple users.</p>
<p>The main goal was to create an intuitive, functional application tailored to real user needs for managing personal belongings.</p>
<h2>Tech Stack and Tools</h2>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We first defined the key features through personas, then moved on to database architecture and wireframes.</p>

<h2>Layered Architecture</h2>

  <figcaption>Global architecture diagram.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The application follows a modular layered architecture, with a clear separation between the frontend and backend. The project is split across two Git repositories. This makes it easier to test or replace each part independently in the future.</p>
<h3>Backend Structure</h3>
<p>The backend is structured into distinct layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routes: define HTTP entry points (e.g., <code>/api/items/:itemId</code>)</li>
<li>Middlewares: handle authentication, permissions (RBAC), validation, or data sanitization</li>
<li>Controllers: contain business logic</li>
<li>Models (via Prisma): handle database access</li>
<li>Utils: reusable utility functions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frontend Structure</h3>
<p>The frontend adopts a hybrid approach, combining two methods. First, the Next.js app router system, which structures the organization of pages according to the application's folders. And secondly, a Domain-Driven Design (DDD)-inspired modular organization for everything else.</p>
<p>Each domain includes a standardized internal structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>hooks: Custom hooks related to the domain</li>
<li>types: TypeScript interfaces</li>
<li>endpoints: Contains API calls and exports them for use in hooks</li>
<li>context: Provides a React context for shared state/functions across components</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>We chose not to implement media/file upload due to time constraints (1 day per week).</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>User data security was integrated from the early stages of development. Authentication relies on a JWT-based system stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS or CSRF attacks. On the backend, every sensitive route is protected by middlewares that check both the user's identity and permissions.</p>
<p>User input is sanitized automatically before being saved to the database via a sanitization middleware. Finally, all sensitive actions are double-checked — first in the frontend, then on the server — ensuring security against URL/API tampering.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The app includes unit tests on the backend and end-to-end (E2E) tests on the frontend. Backend tests (written in Jest) validate critical API functions like item retrieval or updates with permission checks. On the frontend, Cypress E2E scenarios cover full user flows like account creation, joining a shared home, or editing restrictions for items owned by others.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The app is fully self-hosted on a VPS provided by Hetzner. Deployment is managed via Coolify, which simplifies container orchestration. The frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database each run in separate containers. Improving service isolation and making maintenance easier.</p>
<p>A CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions. On each push to <code>main</code> or <code>dev</code>, tests are run, code is auto-formatted, a build is generated, and if successful, a webhook triggers a redeploy on Coolify.</p>
