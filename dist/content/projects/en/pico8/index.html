<h2>Project overview</h2>
<p>This was my first group project since I started to learn to code. We discovered Lua and the Pico-8 game engine. We could create whatever kind of game we wanted. As this was our first project, we always worked together in a mob programming setup. I worked a lot on the creative direction of the game, which involved designing the character sprite, crafting the background and terrain, and developing UI elements.</p>
<h2>Tech stack and tools</h2>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I enjoyed delving into Lua and understanding fundamental game mechanics such as gravity, collisions, and game states. Additionally, I had a great time working on the artwork, despite the challenges posed by the limited color palette of the Pico-8 engine.</p>
