# Hey!

I'm Mathurin Sekine, a fullstack developer currently open to new opportunities.

Previously, I worked as a frontend developer at [Juisci](https://juisci.com), where I contributed to building and improving their web app. You can [learn more about my work there](/en/experiences/juisci).

I recently earned my diploma in Application Design and Development (Bachelor's level) from [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/).

My skill set includes frontend technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, as well as backend frameworks such as Express.js and Nest.js. I'm also comfortable using design tools like Figma, and I am capable of contributing to every stage of a project â€” from concept and UI design to backend architecture and implementation.

If you think I'd be a great fit for your team, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathurinsekine/), [Twitter](https://x.com/mathurin_sekine), or [email](mailto:mathurinsekine@gmail.com). You can also check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14lc7oAt43DVOJXmW-ZMd9ZqO2eX93dSq?usp=sharing) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lemathurin) for more about my experience and work.

Cheers,<br />
Mathurin Sekine
