# Pico-8 game

- School project
- 23/10/2023 -> 02/11/2023
- [View code on Github](https://github.com/lemathurin/pico8)

## Project overview

This was my first group project since I started to learn to code. We discovered Lua and the Pico-8 game engine. We could create whatever kind of game we wanted. As this was our first project, we always worked together in a mob programming setup. I worked a lot on the creative direction of the game, which involved designing the character sprite, crafting the background and terrain, and developing UI elements.

## Tech stack and tools

- Affinity Designer
- Pico-8

## Teammates

## What I learned

I enjoyed delving into Lua and understanding fundamental game mechanics such as gravity, collisions, and game states. Additionally, I had a great time working on the artwork, despite the challenges posed by the limited color palette of the Pico-8 engine.
