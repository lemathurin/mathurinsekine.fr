## Project overview

The objective of this project was to have two teams of five work on the front and back-end, then switch roles after a week. I started on the front-end team and laid the foundation of the design with my mockups in Figma, as well as choosing to use Shadcn/ui. For the second week, I worked in partnership with some from the back-end team to create routes for the admin page.

## Tech stack and tools

- Figma
- React Vite
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind CSS

## What I learned

I learned to better coordinate a team and use a component library. It was also interesting to discover the world of back-end with Supabase and Express.
