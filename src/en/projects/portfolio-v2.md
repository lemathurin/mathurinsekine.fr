# Portfolio V2.1 (current version)

- Personal project
- 07/2025
- [View code on Github](https://github.com/lemathurin/portfolio/tree/main)

## Project overview

After working on a real codebase during my apprenticeship at [Juisci](/en/experiences/juisci), I gained a much stronger understanding of programming compared to when I made the [first version of this portfolio](/en/projects/portfolio-v1).

[I originally made V2 with Next.js](https://github.com/lemathurin/mathurinsekine.fr/tree/v2), but quickly realized that it was not the correct tool for my needs. Most of my content is static and written in markdown, so I decided to move to Eleventy. This has greatly increased the website's speed and decreased its size.

Images are hosted on [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/), and the website is deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Inspiration

A lot (maybe a little too much?) of design inspiration came from [Alexander Sandberg's website](https://alexandersandberg.com/). It's simple and classy, simply lovely.

[Paul Wong's website](https://www.paulwong.work) and [Glenn Hitchcock's website](https://glenn.me/) were also great sources of inspiration.

As I had never used Eleventy before, I used [Kilian Finger's website](https://www.kilianfinger.com/) as a reference for the project structure.
