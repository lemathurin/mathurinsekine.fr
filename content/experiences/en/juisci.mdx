# Juisci

- 13-month long apprenticeship
  - 4 days working, 1 day of classes each week
- Fully remote
- Primarily frontend development, with some backend

At [Juisci](https://juisci.com), a startup in the health tech sector, I played an active role in the evolution of the product, both technically and functionally.

I helped modernize large parts of the application by replacing legacy code with more reliable and maintainable solutions. This involved updating outdated components, removing unused features, and supporting the migration to more recent versions of React and TypeScript.

I also designed and developed key features like the podcast player, the quiz system, and contributed to the introduction of React Query for efficient cache management. These improvements were implemented with a strong focus on user experience, benefiting both end users and internal teams.

I frequently translated mockups into functional components aligned with the existing design system, and regularly handled complex bug fixes under tight deadlines to maintain product stability.

Finally, I contributed to backend and admin panel improvements to make content management easier for non-technical teams.
