<h2>Project overview</h2>
<p>After working on a real codebase during my apprenticeship at <a href="/en/experiences/juisci">Juisci</a>, I gained a much stronger understanding of programming compared to when I made the <a href="/en/projects/portfolio-v1">first version of this portfolio</a>. This updated version was a great opportunity to put my newfound knowledge and skills as a web developer into practice.</p>
<h2>Tech stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Next.js</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>next-intl</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS</li>
<li>Motion</li>
<li>Vercel</li>
</ul>
<h2>A little more info</h2>
<p>In the first version of this portfolio, I used i18n strings for all the text, even for project case studies. It wasn't fun to write anything, who likes to write in JSON files?</p>
<p>For this version, I decided to move everything to MDX files. I can't tell you how much easier and enjoyable it is to add or modify text now üòÖ.</p>
<p>For the rendered MDX content, I initially used Tailwind's prose styles. I ended up not loving the final result, so I removed <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> and just made my own styles. I haven‚Äôt covered every possible element yet, as this website is a continuous work in progress. (There's still so much to do.)</p>
<p>I also tried to make the website as accessible as possible, a big step up from the previous version, with better semantic HTML, improved color contrast, and fewer animations.</p>
<p>Images are hosted on <a href="https://uploadthing.com/">UploadThing</a>, and the website is deployed with <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.</p>
<p>For the next iteration, I might not use Next.js and just use HTML and CSS ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This framework is a little bit overkill for my needs, and is quite heavy to send.</p>
<p>Performance can definitely be improved. That's something I'll work on soon.</p>

<p>After some reflecting, I would have been better off using a static site generator like Eleventy or Hugo üòë.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>A lot (maybe a little too much?) of inspiration came from <a href="https://alexandersandberg.com/">Alexander Sandberg's website</a>. It's simple and classy, simply lovely.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paulwong.work">Paul Wong's website</a> and <a href="https://glenn.me/">Glenn Hitchcock's website</a> were also great sources of inspiration.</p>
